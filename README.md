# Project Description 
Developing a Power BI dashboard to analyze hotel reservation data, uncover customer trends, optimize sales strategies, and improve operational efficiency using ETL processes, data cleaning, web scraping, and advanced analytics, enabling data-driven decision-making for long-term business growth.

## Problem Statement
A hotel is striving to enhance its profitability and improve the sales strategies that drive its growth. The hotel aims to make more informed decisions about its business expansion and overall management by analyzing past performance data. However, to achieve this, they need a more intelligent, data-driven approach that will allow them to uncover hidden trends, understand customer behaviors, and optimize operations in a way that supports long-term success.
As data analysts, we were approached by the hotel to help them leverage the data stored in their Excel files over the past three years. This data, which includes booking information, customer demographics, and revenue statistics, needs to be transformed into actionable insights. By doing so, the hotel will be able to:
•	Identify trends in customer behavior and revenue growth
•	Evaluate the performance of various sales strategies over time
•	Make smarter decisions on future developments, including infrastructure and service offerings
•	Enhance operational efficiency by understanding key patterns in bookings, customer preferences, and seasonal fluctuations
In essence, the hotel seeks our expertise to turn raw data into strategic recommendations that can improve their decision-making and overall business performance. The objective is to provide an intelligent, data-driven foundation for the hotel’s future growth and success.

## Solution
The hotel managers raised several important questions that we needed to answer using the available data. These questions were:
•	Has our revenue increased over time (yearly)?
•	Is it necessary to increase our parking capacity?
•	What trends can you identify in the data?
However, after gaining a deeper understanding of the business, I decided to add a few more questions to guide the analysis and provide more valuable insights. The goal was not only to answer their initial queries but also to create a dashboard that would empower the hotel management to make better, data-driven decisions for their business.
The key to a data analyst’s role is truly understanding the business in order to identify its critical bottlenecks and areas for improvement. In essence, by asking the right questions and providing answers, we can offer the business leaders a fresh perspective that drives smarter decisions and ultimately fosters growth.
The additional questions I introduced were:
•	From which countries do most of our customers come?
•	Which market segment has brought us the most customers?
•	Has the room reserved been assigned to the guest? If not, how many rooms are exceptions to this?
•	Which agent or company has made the most reservations for us?
•	How many days in advance do customers typically book their stays?
By doing this, the dashboard we built will not only answer the initial set of questions but will also give them a tool that provides ongoing insights, allowing them to adapt and optimize strategies as needed.

 

## AIMS Grid:
By using the AIMS grid project management tool, we made sure what are the purpose, stakeholder, end result and success criteria of our project.

## Steps-Followed-in-this-Project
1.	Learned about AIMS Grid for Project Planning:
Familiarized with the AIMS grid project management tool to define the purpose, stakeholders, end results, and success criteria for the project, ensuring clear objectives and direction.
2.	Data Collection and Integration:
Retrieved and consolidated data from multiple Excel sheets (2018, 2019, 2020) into a structured database using MySQL, ensuring proper integration for analysis.
3.	Web Scraping for Country Data:
Used Python and the BeautifulSoup library to scrape country and continent data from Wikipedia, storing it in an Excel file. This data was then integrated into the Power BI model to provide insights into customer demographics by country and continent.
4.	Data Cleaning in Power Query:
Cleaned the raw data in Power Query by handling missing values, removing unnecessary columns, and correcting inconsistencies to ensure data accuracy and integrity.
5.	Performed ETL Process (Extract, Transform, Load):
Applied the ETL process to extract data from various sources, transform it into a useful format for analysis, and load it into Power BI for visualization and reporting.
6.	Created Measures for Data Analysis:
Developed custom measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate key metrics such as revenue, booking trends, and customer demographics, ensuring these metrics were integrated into the visuals.
7.	Data Visualization in Power BI:
Created dynamic dashboards and visuals in Power BI to answer key business questions, such as revenue trends, customer demographics, and operational efficiency, providing actionable insights for the hotel management.
